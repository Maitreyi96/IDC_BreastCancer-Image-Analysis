# IDC_BreastCancer-Image-Analysis

Aim:
The aim of this Deep Learning project was to identify and classify the Histology images IDC
positive and IDC negative groups according to the presence of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
(IDC) in the histopathology images of the breast tissue.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to build a neural network which could able to identify and
classify the images according presence of cancerous cells in the breasts with a good accuracy
and precision and to help make the breast cancer detection automated process using the
machine learning techniques.
